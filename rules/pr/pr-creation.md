# PR Creation Workflow Rules

- When creating a PR, always automatically assign it to the current user.
- By default, create the PR in draft mode unless the user explicitly says "ready for review".
- Automatically fill the PR description based on the work done (summarize the changes, root cause,
  solution, files modified, and verification steps).
